# 21 Days JavaScript Sprint

Welcome to the **21-Days-JavaScript-Sprint**! This project is a 21-day learning journey designed to help you master JavaScript concepts through practical coding exercises. Each folder contains challenges and exercises on different topics, building upon your knowledge day by day.

## Directory Structure

The project is divided into 7 major sections, each focusing on key JavaScript concepts:

- **01 Arrays & Objects**: Introduction to arrays and objects, basic operations, and methods.
- **02 Loops and Iteration**: Focuses on loops, iteration, and how to process collections.
- **03 String and Encoding**: Understanding string manipulation, encoding, and common string methods.
- **04 Conditionals**: Covers conditionals like `if`, `else`, and `switch` for decision making in code.
- **05 Functions and Prototypes**: In-depth look at functions, function expressions, and prototypes.
- **06 Closure and Lexical Scope**: Explains closures, lexical scope, and how functions can "remember" their environment.
- **07 Array - Higher Order Functions**: Understanding higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to each folder and start with the exercises for that day.
3. Work through the challenges, which will gradually increase in difficulty.

## Prerequisites

You should have basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax before starting this sprint. If you're new to JavaScript, it's recommended to go through basic tutorials first.

## Setup

To get started, simply open the challenge folders and start coding! There are no additional setup steps required, as everything is designed to be run directly in your browser or any JavaScript runtime environment.
